Change mulligan and play functions to call a score() function on the GwentCard and GwentCardCombo level.
	score should take the game object as an argument, as well as # turns left in round.
	bloodthirst, dot
	to avoid handling the single card case and combo case, should likely change design such that all single cards are added to the combos object
	this will let the play function sort only based on score, and dont have to have case structures to handle comparing single cards to combos.
		if we do this, we need to modify the combo bar charts to only add items where the size of the combo.cards is greater than one.
	
anti-combos -- example: witchers, requires only one in hand.
	can extend to cards like roach which want to sit in deck.
	this can be done by having a mulligan variable on the gwentcard level
	0 to disable or 1 to enable.  if a vector of cards is empty, always mulligan (roach).
	if vector of cards is not empty, mulligan if any of the cards in the vector is in hand.
	can also accomplish by doing as combos with negatie value
	
fix rng in static simthread functions

record each time a card is mulliganed, and display the most mulliganed cards
	
make the distribution of bloodthirst balance eachother (add up to 100)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Doing now:

just added front end of bloodthirst distribution

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

on hold:

technically rng being seeded the same shouldn't matter? still fix.

Oh shit.  Our random function is being seeded the same everytime.

all the random functions are fucked (all 3).  not seeding to random value, same order execution everytime.
