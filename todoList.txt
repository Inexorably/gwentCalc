anti-combos -- example: witchers, requires only one in hand.
	can extend to cards like roach which want to sit in deck.
	this can be done by having a mulligan variable on the gwentcard level
	0 to disable or 1 to enable.  if a vector of cards is empty, always mulligan (roach).
	if vector of cards is not empty, mulligan if any of the cards in the vector is in hand.
	can also accomplish by doing as combos with negatie value

	should do this with having an anticombo table next to the combo table and making a isNotSubset function.

set max and min on the line drawings so that we can see the results better

done?

dot
record each time a card is mulliganed, and display the most mulliganed cards

on hold:

technically rng being seeded the same shouldn't matter? still fix.

Oh shit.  Our random function is being seeded the same everytime.

all the random functions are fucked (all 3).  not seeding to random value, same order execution everytime.
